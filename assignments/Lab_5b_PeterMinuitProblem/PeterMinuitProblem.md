# **2. (Peter Minuit Problem)
# ***Legend has it that, in 1626, Peter Minuit purchased Manhattan Island for $24.00 in barter. Did he make a good investment? To answer this question, modify the compound interest program of Fig. 5.6 of your text (pages 165-166) to begin with a principal of $24.00 and to calculate the amount of interest on deposit if that money had been kept on deposit until this year (e. g., 387 years through 2015). Place the for loop that performs the compound interest calculation in an outer for loop that varies the interest rate from 5% to 10% to observe the wonders of compound interest.
