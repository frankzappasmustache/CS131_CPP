I had already set my profile up to some extent, but I went ahead and added Twitter and Google Drive as registered services, with Twitter set to publicly available for contact purposes.

I also wrote a biography,  included links to my Github Pages site (still quite unfinished), my Github profile, my Bitbucket Profile, my Slack room, and two Github repositories I created for this class (CS131) and the other class I am taking this semester (IT121).

I had not yet gone through to tweak my notifications, but I am glad it was part of this assignment because I really despise excessive notifications.

I went ahead and turned off all notifications for my personal email address and Twitter account, and adjusted some of the notifications going to my BTC email based on urgency and importance.

Below is a list of notification adjustments:
