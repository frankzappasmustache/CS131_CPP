## * Target Heart-Rate Calculator:
    * While exercising, one can use a heart-rate monitor to see that their heart rate stays within a safe range suggested by their trainers and doctors. According to the American Heart Association (AHA), the formula for calculating one's maximum heart rate in beats per minute is 220 minus their age in years. One's target heart rate is a range that is 50–85% of their maximum heart rate. [Note: These formulas are estimates provided by the AHA. Maximum and target heart rates may vary based on the health, fitness and gender of the individual. Always consult a physician or qualified health care professional before beginning or modifying an exercise program.]

    Create a class called HeartRates. The class attributes should include the person’s first name, last name and date of birth (consisting of separate attributes for the month, day and year of birth). Your class should have a constructor that receives this data as parameters. For each attribute provide set and get functions. The class also should include a function getAge that calculates and returns the person’s age (in years), a function getMaxiumumHeartRate that calculates and returns the person’s maximum heart rate and a function getTargetHeartRate that calculates and returns the person’s target heart rate.

    Since the programmer does not yet know how to obtain the current date from the computer, function getAge should prompt the user to enter the current month, day and year before calculating the person’s age.

    Write an application that prompts for the person’s information, instantiates an object of class HeartRates and prints the information from that object— including the person’s first name, last name and date of birth— then calculates and prints the person’s age (years), maximum heart rate and target-heart-rate range.
