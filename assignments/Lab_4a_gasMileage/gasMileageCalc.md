Programming Assignment 3

(Gas Mileage) Drivers are concerned with the mileage obtained by their automobiles. One driver has kept track of several trips by recording miles driven and gallons used for each trip.

Develop a C++ program that uses a while statement to input the miles driven and gallons used for each trip. The program should calculate and display the miles per gallon obtained for each trip and print the combined miles per gallon obtained for all tanks up to this point.

Enter miles driven (- 1 to quit): 287
Enter gallons used: 13
MPG this trip: 22.076923
Total MPG: 22.076923

Enter miles driven (- 1 to quit): 200
Enter gallons used: 10
MPG this trip: 20.000000
Total MPG: 21.173913

Enter the miles driven (- 1 to quit): 120
Enter gallons used: 5
MPG this trip: 24.000000
Total MPG: 21.678571

Enter the miles used (- 1 to quit): - 1
